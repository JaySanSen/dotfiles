ln -s ~/Desktop/personal/dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
ln -s ~/Desktop/personal/dotfiles/nvim ~/.config/nvim


The directory structure we create in the other location (in this case personal files) should match the folder structure of what we are trying to create.

for example nvim files are placed in .config/nvim so the nvim files should be placed in dotfiles/nvim (dotfiles - is just a random name take which in this case acts like the .config folder)

ln -s ~/Desktop/personal/dotfiles/Code/User/settings.json  ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json   -> this is for vscode settings.json



to create sym links
editing any place will create the changes in the other place since they are linked to each other

to remove links use the rm command.
ex: rm ~/.gitconfig
this will just remove the link and leave the original file in the dotfiles directory
